You are the combined Creative Director, Principal Product Designer, Motion Director, and Conversion Architect for Zephra. Build the most premium, high-converting landing page on the web. Think Apple-level clarity and restraint, getkong.ai-level cinematic system visuals, perspective.co-level kinetic UI, and hyros.ai-level direct-response performance rigor. Every decision must increase comprehension, trust, and action.

SOURCE OF TRUTH — COPY-LOCK

Import the full page copy from the user’s text document titled “Zephra Landing Page — FINAL” (or the latest Zephra copy provided in this chat).

Render all text verbatim (headings, bullets, CTAs, trust bars). No paraphrasing.

If copy exceeds a viewport, design smart reveal patterns (tabs/accordions/pins) without changing wording.

BRAND

Use Zephra’s brand tokens (color, radius, elevation, grid) if known. Else define:

Primary = Brand Indigo, Accent = Electric Blue, Secondary = Deep Charcoal, Surface = Near-Black, Success = Emerald.

Radii: 20–28px for cards/CTAs; shadows soft and short (premium, not floaty).

Typography: SF-esque variable sans (Display/Title/Text), optical size enabled, tracking tight on display (-1% to -2%). Fallback: Inter/Manrope.

Visual language: glass-precision, subtle light, no noise, no skeuomorphic chrome.

FAQ

Final Transformation + Dual CTAs + Trust

GLOBAL MOTION GRAMMAR (premium only)

Transforms/opacity only for performance; no layout jank.

Easing: cubic-bezier(.22, .61, .36, 1) for main; micro snap (.12, .9, .39, 1).

Durations: section entrances 320–420ms; stagger 60–90ms; micro 140–200ms.

Ambient drift ≤ 2–3% luminance/position, 6–12s cycles, never distracting.

prefers-reduced-motion: replace motion with clean fades/instant states.

Cap 2 concurrent timelines per viewport; 60fps budget; zero CLS.

SEMANTIC MOTION (animation must explain the words)

“Autopilot” → inertial glides, self-propelling lines.

“24/72 hours” → clock arc sweep + day/night wash.

“$7.8B data” / “supercomputer” → calm network pulses, not flashy.

“Five departments → one” → segmented ring unifies.

“3–5x / ROI” → precise count-ups with tick marks (no bounce).

“From confusion to clarity” → blur→focus alignment.

SECTION-LEVEL DIRECTION (implement exactly)

1) HERO (“You’re One Funnel Away…”)

Headline: mask-reveal word-by-word L→R (total ≈900ms), last word lingers +60ms.

Subheadline: soft rise 16px + fade (260ms).

A thin luminous funnel path draws toward the Primary CTA (~700ms) then freezes.

Bullets: checkmarks micro-pop (0.94→1, 180ms) with 70ms stagger.

Primary CTA hover: magnetic lift 2px; pressed: settle 1px; Secondary CTA underline ink sweep center→edges (180ms).

Background: motion-lit gradient, barely drifting; no particles.

Trust bar plate slides in (220ms).

Goal: immediate authority; no loops after settle.

2) PLATFORM REVELATION (“Tesla of Marketing Automation”)

Split: left = “traditional team” busy cluster (3–5 small cards with slight desync drift), right = Zephra panel that clicks into grid (snap 220ms).

Provide a scrubbable before/after handle: dragging defocuses left (0→8px) and sharpens right (8→0px). Release to 70/30 in Zephra’s favor.

When copy mentions 3–5x or 24 hours, run minimal count-ups and draw a clock arc once.

Goal: contrast chaos vs calm precision.

3) TRANSFORMATION NAV (Five Departments)

Central segmented ring with five arcs; active segment glows lightly; pointer rotates with inertia; content fades/slides ≤ 16px.

“What it replaces” chips slide in from ring (32px).

Progress dots 1–5 increment as tabs change (dispatch analytics).

3a) Strategy Engine

Grid snaps into a 3-tier map (Awareness → Consideration → Conversion); connectors draw (450ms).

Persona icon with radial callout chips; lines draw 140ms each.

Budget bar fills to exact % (no bounce).

Positioning: competitors slide out 24px; Zephra card slots forward 16px.

3b) Creative Orchestrator

Hooks carousel: active card “types” first 3–4 words at 8–10 chars/sec, caret blinks 2× then hides.

UGC storyboard: 3 frames step-cut (220ms per frame) on play.

A/B cards flip (y-rotate 180°, motion blur ≤ 6px), 360ms.

3c) Funnel Architect

A path line draws across waypoints; each pulses once when reached.

Micro page previews flip in at each waypoint; a padlock locks at Checkout.

3d) Email & SMS Automation

Horizontal timeline rail with sequences as dots; selecting slides the rail; expanded panel shows behavioral triggers animating once.

Dynamic fields flash highlight 120ms then normalize.

3e) Performance Intelligence

Metric tiles count up (≤1.2s).

Spark lines draw cleanly L→R (no wobble).

“Creative Refresh Signal” underlines itself once when fatigue detected; a card restack animates on filter change.

4) WORKFLOW MASTERY (Pinned Scrollytelling: 72 Hours)

Pinned viewport with four beats:

Hour 1: floating questions converge into an ordered stack.

2–24h: background shifts night→dawn, network nodes light in waves (“Zephra working”).

25–48h: labeled delivery tray slides in (Strategy/Ads/Funnel/Email/Playbook).

49–72h: a launch arc completes; status light holds green.

Progress ring completes across these beats.

Reduced motion: swap to a 4-step accordion with identical content.

5) BUSINESS MODEL OPTIMIZATION (Tabbed)

Tabs: E-com, Service, Coaching, SaaS, Local. Lock underline grows center→edges; panel fades/slides ≤ 16px.

Micro-icons:

E-com: product card → cart.

Service: calendar slot fills.

Coaching: ribbon wraps a course tile.

SaaS: activation bar fills.

Local: pin drops; ring radiates once.

6) INTEGRATIONS

Logo wall: slow auto-marquee; pause on hover; active logo crisps + lifts 2px.

Accordions by category (Meta, ESP, CRM, Pages, Analytics); height+opacity reveal (220ms).

“One-click deploy” chip: inline checkmark ticks once.

7) PRICING

Cards stagger in 80ms; Professional gets a one-time soft sparkle (600ms) on its badge.

Hover tilt ≤ 4°; price numerals lift 2px.

Inclusions reveal via mask clip (no height jank).

Guarantee shield draws its perimeter once (400ms).

8) FAQ

Chevron rotates 0→90°; panel reveals with opacity+pre-measured height; deep-link open pulses underline once (120ms).

9) FINAL TRANSFORMATION

Paragraphs breathe in (fade+rise 12px) with cadence; both CTAs slide up together; urgency line gives a single caret blink then stillness.

Ambient motion stops here to signal commitment.

MICRO-INTERACTIONS (global)

Links: underline grows from center (120ms).

Chips: lift 2px on hover; focus ring = brand glow 2px.

Tooltips: fade+rise 8px (120ms); arrow reveals via clip.

Copy buttons: on click, “Copied” slides in (140ms), fades after 900ms.

Scroll progress bar (2px) at top; pauses when modal/overlay open.

ACCESSIBILITY & PERFORMANCE

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Maintain AA contrast; 45–75ch line lengths (cap ~68ch for long paragraphs).

Tab/Shift-Tab explores all interactives in logical order.

Core Web Vitals targets: LCP ≤ 2.5s, CLS ≤ 0.1, INP ≤ 200ms.

Pre-measure accordion/tab heights; reserve media aspect ratios; zero CLS.

Lazy-load below-the-fold media; prefetch next-section assets on idle.

Text selection stays intact (animate masks, not letters).

CONVERSION SYSTEM

Primary CTA is always visible at hero; secondary present but visually subordinate.

Sticky header reappears on scroll-up only (Apple-like); contains a small CTA.

Repeat primary CTA after Pricing and Final Transformation.

Exit-intent (desktop): quiet modal with two buttons (Demo / Explore Plans); no animation if reduced-motion.

Trust badges appear near every major CTA.

ANALYTICS EVENTS (emit cleanly)

hero_cta_click, secondary_cta_click, tabs_change_{dept}, workflow_step_{1..4}, pricing_plan_select, faq_open_{slug}, integration_expand_{group}, page_depth_{25|50|75|100}.

Debounce scroll events; no double fires.

DELIVERABLES

A complete, responsive landing page implementing all above directives with Zephra’s exact copy and brand tokens.

Provide exported assets (SVG icons, LQIP covers), SEO meta + OG image, and JSON config of animation timings/easings.

Include reduced-motion variant, color/typography tokens, and a QA checklist mapping each copy block to its animation.

QA CHECKLIST (must pass before done)

All copy present verbatim; no truncation or rewording.

Animations run once per section then rest; nothing loops distractingly.

All expand/collapse patterns are measurable and keyboard-navigable.

CTAs visible without complex interactions; focus states clear.

No CLS on any open/close action; 60fps on motion-capable devices.

SUCCESS CRITERIA

The page feels calm, inevitable, and expensive.

Motion explains the message (not decor).

User reaches CTAs with heightened confidence and zero friction.
