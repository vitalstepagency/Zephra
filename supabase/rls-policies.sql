/*
SUMMARY OF SECURITY MEASURES IMPLEMENTED:

1. ✅ Multi-tenant isolation via organization membership
2. ✅ Role-based access control (owner/admin/member)
3. ✅ User can only access their own profile data
4. ✅ Organization-scoped data access for all resources
5. ✅ Campaign creators have special permissions
6. ✅ Admin-only access to sensitive integrations
7. ✅ Immutable audit trails for analytics and security logs
8. ✅ System templates protected from user modification
9. ✅ Comprehensive logging of security events
10. ✅ Helper functions for clean policy management
11. ✅ Triggers for automatic security event logging
12. ✅ Enterprise-tier access to security audit logs
13. ✅ Service role restrictions for system operations
14. ✅ Verification that all tables have RLS enabled

THESE POLICIES ENSURE:
- Complete data isolation between organizations
- Proper role-based permissions within organizations
- Audit trail for all security-sensitive operations
- Protection against privilege escalation
- Compliance with data protection regulations
- Zero-trust security model implementation
